			Hey there,
		</p>
		<p>
			Being that my name has already been made known in the above header, I'll cut right into telling about myself. <br>Born in Springfield, Missouri, I had a fascination with computers from an early age. From piecing and <br>maintaining hardware to exploring programs, using productivity software to playing computer games, I loved <br>everything about PCs. When it came time to select a major for college, it only came naturally to go with <br>what was both marketable and enjoyable. Now, here I am.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy writing, doodling, studying music and music theory, and (in my free time) playig video games, <br> particularly the Metal Gear and Tom Clancy franchises.
